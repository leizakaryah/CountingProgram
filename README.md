# CountingProgram

Write a program to:

•Ask for the user’s Name (and display it back)

•Use a pop-up alert() or other means to confirm the name & number entered

•Ask a user for a number input n, then count from 0 to n on the screen

•Output should display right on the HTML page 

•Use basic CSS to style the output area

•Learn and use best-practice coding standards and conventions (see attached doc)

•Modify the program to count by 2s (or some other increment)
